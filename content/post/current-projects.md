### How To Understand Things
Lina Zikas and I are building a company called "How To Understand Things." Our goal is to learn the best methods for learning and teaching. Most people alive today are terrible at explaining things, and do not understand most of the items and systems that they interact with on a daily basis; we want to study this phenomenon, rigorously define what makes an explanation "good," and then create educational content that explains complicated ideas in new, more effective ways. We are working towards building a web-based, interactive network of content that a user can dive into to learn any subject deeply.

### Three Albums
I'm producing an album called "Hot Pita," revising an album called "Pope Amanda," and writing an album called "Feynman Wine."

### Gan Yourself
I'm building a web store called "GanYouself.com" where users can upload pictures of themselves (or their friend, or their dog) and receive a similar image that has been created by a generative adversarial network (GAN). I will sell canvas prints of these images (along with a pdf packet explaining the process) on the site. My goal is to earn $100,000 during the holiday shopping season, by selling 2000 prints with a $50 margin.
